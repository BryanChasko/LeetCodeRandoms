🏟️ **Gillette Stadium Seating**

📚 **Reference**: A variation on the "Island Perimeter" LeetCode problem 463. Originally, it was described as follows: "Given a row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water, determine the perimeter of the island."

🔢 **Problem Description**:
You are given a grid representing the seating arrangement of Gillette Stadium during the January 16, 2005, divisional round game between the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts. In this grid, 1 represents an occupied seat, and 0 represents an empty seat. The seats are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). There are no seats beyond the edge of the grid, so you can treat the edge as an empty seat ('0').

Our task is to determine the total boundary length of the occupied seats. The boundary is defined as the number of sides of occupied seats that are either adjacent to an empty seat or the edge of the grid. We have built a solution in main.cpp

🚀 Running the Code with Perl Script

To automate the compilation and execution of the program, we have created a Perl script. The script will compile the C++ code and run the executable if the compilation is successful. we have created run.pl for these purposes.  

Make the Script Executable: 
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing run.pl.
Run the command: chmod +x run.pl 

Run the Script:
Execute the script by running: ./run.pl
